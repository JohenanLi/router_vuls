## Vulnerability Details

The Tenda AC10V4.0 V16.03.10.13 has a buffer overflow vulnerability. The vulnerability is triggered in the `fromSetIpMacBind` function when it retrieves the value of the list parameter at line 57, and ultimately causes an overflow at line 67 in the `FUN_0049e098` function during the sscanf call. As a result, by requesting the page, an attacker can easily execute a **denial of service** attack or **remote code execution**.

bindnum_value = "1"
list_value = "a" + "\x12" * 500 + "z" * 500  

data = {
    "bindnum": bindnum_value,
    "list": list_value
}
